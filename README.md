# Telecom Company Call Center Dashboard Project
## Key Learning Points:
* Understand how to design a Power BI dashboard to represent KPIs and metrics clearly.  
* Gain insights into customer satisfaction and agent performance in a call center environment.  
* Learn how to interpret and analyze telecom data, focusing on response times and customer engagement.  
* Explore the application of data visualization techniques to provide business value.
## Business Problem
* Telecom Marketing Competition: Telecom companies continuously promote their services with promises of better prices or service. However, the real question is: What do customers truly want?  
* Client’s Need: A large telecom company seeks a dashboard that offers insights into their call center operations, focusing on KPIs that measure customer satisfaction, agent performance, and call handling efficiency.  
## Rationale of the Project
* Customer Insight: The client needs an understanding of how customers interact with their call center and what contributes to satisfaction or dissatisfaction.  
* Operational Efficiency: By analyzing call metrics and agent performance, the client aims to improve the efficiency of the call center and enhance customer service.  
* Data-Driven Decision-Making: A dashboard will enable the telecom company to make informed decisions based on data trends, ultimately improving both agent performance and customer experiences.  
## Aim of the Project
* Create a Power BI Dashboard: Develop a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the telecom company’s call center.    
* Provide Actionable Insights: Help the client better understand customer satisfaction, call handling performance, and agent effectiveness to make data-backed improvements.    
## Data Description
* Customer Satisfaction Data: Overall satisfaction ratings based on interactions with the call center.    
### Call Metrics:
* Calls Answered/Abandoned: The number of calls answered versus those abandoned by customers.  
* Calls by Time: Time-based analysis of call volume (e.g., peak hours).  
* Average Speed of Answer (ASA): The time taken for agents to answer calls.  
###  Agent Performance:
* Handle Time vs Calls Answered: A quadrant analysis that compares the average talk duration per agent against the number of calls answered.  
## Tech Stack
* Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.     
* Excel: For any pre-processing or additional data manipulation.    
## Project Scope
* Data Collection and Cleaning: Gather the dataset provided by the telecom company and ensure it’s clean for use in Power BI.  
### Dashboard Design:
* Visualize Overall Customer Satisfaction to highlight how customers perceive the service.  
* Show Calls Answered vs Abandoned to provide insights into call center efficiency.  
* Present Calls by Time to identify peak periods and optimize resource allocation.  
* Track Average Speed of Answer to understand how quickly agents are responding to calls.
* Analyze Agent’s Performance Quadrant by comparing Average Handle Time and Calls Answered to categorize agents and identify training needs.
